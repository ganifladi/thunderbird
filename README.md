# White Thunderbird Icons
this is not a thunderbird theme! this repository only applies some nice white icons, perfect for a black theme.
for full themes please visit https://github.com/spymastermatt/thunderbird-monterail (which is also the author of the icons. all credit should go to him!)

USAGE:
1. Download .zip
2. Extract and copy/move the chrome directory inside your thunderbird profile directory (should be called something like xyz.profile)
3. Profit.

In case you already have a chrome directory inside your profile directory please append the content!

For a nice black theme have a look at this stylish CSS: https://userstyles.org/styles/144424/dark-flat-minimal-thunderbird-boom-bird
